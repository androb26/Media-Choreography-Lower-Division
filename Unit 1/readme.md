# Unit 1: Responsive Media Instruments
### Outcome:
        What is a Realtime Media Instrument?  Continuously nuanced gestural response vs discrete “if-then” logic.   
        Examples (e.g.  Adriene M and Claire B, David Rokeby, Chunky Move)
### Exercise:
        -Using provided standalone Max applications, write-up a description of the experience created using the supplied, default media. 
        -Describe the qualities of both the unmodified input, and the processed output. 
        -Find new media to replace what was supplied with the assignment.
        -Describe the qualities of the replacement media, and the new processed output.
        -Describe what is qualitatively different in the original media and the processed outputs.
        -Explain in your own words how the processed output was changed.
### Supplied Application(s):
        -Single application
        -Should be parameter wise fairly simple. (e.g. only modifiable parameters being the input media.)
        -Takes both audio and video as input.
        -Output effects can be spectacular, while also being legible as to how the input media played a role.
        -Video could come from the “Toy Effect” List in SC
        -Audio could be manipulated by sc.delaysequencer~
        -Minimalist UI window on Standalone.
        -Max Source Options + Media:

### Test Notes:
(From Andrew)
- "Audio Disintergration Edges" preset 3 turns the volume slider down.
- "Hue Pitch Shift" should have a jit.world window too so students can see the correlation of how the hue of the video changes it's pitch.
- "luminosity pitch shift" should also have jit.world window for the same reason. It's really hard to understand how hue or luminosity is changing the pitch if I can't see the video.
- "Audio HSL Shift" & "video DelaySequence" were very fun to play with.
- "Motion Reverb Frame differencing" was also incredibly fun to play with however if student has never used max or any DAW they may not understand some of the terminology being used in the description such (Frame Differencing, Reverb, Peakamp...)
