# Unit 4: Demystifying Techniques
### Outcome:
Understanding the principles of media processing techniques already demonstrated in the course through the given applications or reference materials.   How is video and audio represented as numbers and arrays?  Operating on video and audio…  Transcoding audio ←→ video.  Furthermore, sensor data (from eg OSCulator) to modulate video / audio?

### Exercise:  
 - Pick an “interactive” or responsive media work.  (See examples, e.g. in References)
 - Fill in the blackboxed technique to map from input to output.
 - Map the the technique in this manner:
 - Input Media Type
    - Video, Audio, Video + Audio
- Feature Extraction
    - What elements of the input are highlighted, analyzed, focused on.
- Mapping
    -  How do the features from the previous step determine how to modify the input?
- Output
    - What is given as final feedback to the visitor / client / user?

### Given Application(s):
- Any of the applications from the preceding 3 units.
- Examples that show transcoding of data video ←→ audio

### Test Notes:
(from Andrew)
- I am confused about the given directions for this unit. Without more explaination, I geniunely don't understand what you are asking students to do using the previously given standalones.
