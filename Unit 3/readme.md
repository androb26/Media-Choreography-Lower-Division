# Unit 3: Sound instruments
### Outcome:
   Media curating part 2. What qualities of audio inputs are best suited to different methods of feature extraction and modification / manipulation?
### Exercise:
    - Students are provided with 3 different audio processing apps and 4 - 6 different audio samples
    - Audio samples from field recordings, film & television, popular music, (drones?).
    - Should contain a mix of atmospheric noises, high mastering vs raw unmixed, voices, instrumentation, complex vs simple soundscapes.
    - Students should try out each audio sample with each audio app.
    - Students then describe in 1-2 paragraphs per application which samples worked best and worst as input.
    - Include qualitative rationale as to why a sample is ranked a certain way.
### Given Application(s):
    - 3 applications
        - fffb~ based (simpler filterbanks or stretchbanks)
        - delay sequencer
        - granular synthesizer
    - something with reverb?

### Test notes
(From Andrew)
- Simple_FFFb seems to only have one working audio buffer at the moment.
- simple soundscape is incredibly fun to experiment with. It needs to have the same panning feature from simple_fffb
